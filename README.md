# Media Portal
1. This is a team project that I have worked with four other classmets. The purpose of this website is to provide an equal representation of
the liberal and conservative media.

2. Users can search on any political topic and the website will present them with articles and videos from both liberal and conservative
media sources.

3. Users can further drill down to either liberal or conservative news or select one particular media outlet.

4. The "Feedback" page allows users to leave us feedback that are being stored in the Firebase database. We display up to 10 feedbacks from our
database that has received 4 or above ranking.

5. The contacts page shows our site location via Google Map and sends out an email to our customer service mailbox once the user fills out the
contact form.

6. The top of the website displays current location, temparature and time.
